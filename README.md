# Heat Conduction

The *heat conduction equation*, *thermal conduction equation* or *heat equation* is defined as follows:

$$
    \alpha \nabla^2 T(\mathbf{r}, t) = \frac{\partial T(\mathbf{r}, t)}{\partial t},
$$

where $\alpha$ is the constant of thermal conductivity, which its value depends on the physical properties of the matter, and $T$ is the temperature.

There are three approaches available in this repository:

- [Two-dimensional simulation](./docs/2d.md)
    - [Square lattice](./docs/2d.md#square-lattice)
    - [Hexagonal lattice](./docs/2d.md#hexagonal-lattice)
